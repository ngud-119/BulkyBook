<h1>BulkyBook</h1>

ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 5), ASP.NET Core Razor Pages, Dependency Injection, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server, CRUD Operations. Other features will be added soon.

This <em><strong>ongoing application</strong></em> uses MVC design pattern. So far, it performs CRUD Operations utilising Entity Framework Core. Once this application is done, the user should be able to order books online in bulk and get good discounts. The user will be able to order as a company or as an individual user. The user will be able to log in through Facebook or Google account. Aside from these, there are more features that will be added so I better stop typing and start coding.
